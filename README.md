# Maximum Entropy Models from Phase Harmonic Covariances 
Code for the [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10017)
======================================

* Dataset at [[url]](https://cloud.irit.fr/s/PIVBO4JJBT73rcp)
* Results about Model A,B,C,D can be obtained using the code in paperA and paper2
* Plots can be made using the code in plot2

## Setup
* This code only supports PyTorch with version <=1.7.1 (due to the change of FFT interface)
* See installation instructions at [[Kymatio]](https://github.com/kymatio/)
