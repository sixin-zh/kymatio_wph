Maximum Entropy Models from Phase Harmonic Covariances [(paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10017)
======================================

* Results about Model A,B,C,D can be obtained using the code in paperA and paper2
* Plots can be made using the code in plot2
* This code only support PyTorch (<=1.7.1) due to the change of FFT interface
* See installation instructions at [[Kymatio]](https://github.com/kymatio/)
