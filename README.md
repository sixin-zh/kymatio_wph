Code to reproduce the results in the paper: 
[2021] Sixin Zhang, Stéphane Mallat. Maximum Entropy Models from Phase Harmonic Covariances.
======================================

* Results about Model A,B,C,D can be obtained using the code in paperA and paper2
* Plots can be made using the code in plot2
* This code only support PyTorch (<=1.7.1) due to the change of FFT interface
